    <h1>Prune to Prosper</h1>
    <div class="content">
        The human instinct is to add. We add features, rules, tasks, habits. It feels good—productive, even. Progress is often measured by how much we’ve created or accumulated. But here’s the truth: what we don’t do, what we don’t have, what we remove—those are the things that truly define us.<br><br>Left unchecked, our creations become overgrown. Systems get clogged. Processes become unwieldy. A garden left untended grows wild—not in a good way, but in a way that smothers the very plants we’re trying to cultivate. That’s how organizations fail. That’s how relationships strain. That’s how burnout sneaks up on you.<br><br>Marcus Aurelius understood this. He wrote, “Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?’” That’s not a question we’re used to asking ourselves. Instead, we default to the opposite: “What else can I add? What else can I do? What else will make me look productive?” The result is predictable: clutter.<br><br>Let’s consider a beach—perfect, pristine, inviting. A single piece of trash washes ashore. It’s manageable. Easy to pick up. But if we ignore it? More follows. Soon, there’s not much of a beach left to enjoy. Our projects, our routines, our very lives are no different. Without the discipline to prune, to remove what isn’t necessary, clutter accumulates until all that’s left is mess.<br><br>The truth is, subtraction doesn’t come naturally to us. It’s invisible work. Nobody notices the clutter you prevented, the unnecessary thing you didn’t add. It’s not flashy or glamorous. But pruning is essential. A system that doesn’t have built-in mechanisms to periodically clear the weeds is doomed to collapse. Slowly at first. Then all at once.<br><br>In our work, our relationships, our lives, we must resist the urge to pile on more. We need to learn the discipline of pruning—not just for efficiency, but for clarity and resilience. To do less, but better.<br><br>As Epictetus said, “You become what you give your attention to.” If our attention is scattered across a thousand unnecessary obligations, if our systems are weighed down by excess, how can we possibly focus on what matters most?<br><br>This isn’t about doing less for its own sake or cutting recklessly. Pruning is about purpose. It’s the quiet, unglamorous process of clearing what doesn’t serve so what does can thrive. It’s asking yourself tough but vital questions: What’s essential? What’s noise? What can I let go of?<br><br>Those who embrace this discipline leave behind something remarkable—not a sprawling mess of additions, but a clear and intentional legacy. Their systems work. Their relationships flourish. Their lives feel lighter, freer.<br><br>So, ask yourself: What can I prune today? A habit that no longer serves you? A commitment that drags you down? A process that’s outlived its usefulness? Don’t wait for the collapse. Don’t wait until it’s too much to handle. Start small, but start now.<br><br>Because when you prune, you don’t just survive. You prosper.
