# Tool Isolation Strategy

Strategy for ensuring tools can be tested and run independently.

## Core Principles

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined boundaries with explicit interfaces
2. **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions (traits), not implementations
3. **No Circular Dependencies**: Prevent circular dependencies
4. **Shared Libraries**: Extract shared code to common libraries
5. **Independent Testing**: Each tool must be testable in isolation

## Implementation

### Common Interfaces

Define common traits in `common/traits`:

- `ContentCreator`: Interface for creating content
- `ContentEditor`: Interface for editing content
- `TopicManager`: Interface for managing topics
- `ImageProcessor`: Interface for processing images

### Dependency Injection

Each tool component receives its dependencies through:

- Constructor parameters
- Builder patterns
- Service locators when appropriate

### Testing Approach

1. Mock interfaces for tests
2. Inject mock implementations
3. Test tools in isolation
4. Verify integration separately
