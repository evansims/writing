# Testing Infrastructure

Overview of the testing approach for the Write CLI ecosystem.

## Principles

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 80%+ code coverage
2. **Test Isolation**: Independent testing of components
3. **Multiple Test Types**: Unit, Integration, Property-based tests
4. **Consistent Structure**: Standardized organization
5. **Test Quality**: Mutation testing for effectiveness
6. **Performance**: Efficient execution with caching

## Test Structure

Tests are organized by type:

- `/unit/`: Tests for individual components
- `/integration/`: Tests for component interactions
- `/property/`: Property-based tests for invariants

## Tools

- **cargo nextest**: Primary test runner
- **llvm-cov**: Coverage measurement
- **cargo-mutants**: Mutation testing

## Mocking Strategy

1. **Interface-Based**: Test against trait interfaces
2. **Dependency Injection**: Inject dependencies
3. **Isolation**: Test each component separately
4. **Minimal Scope**: Mock only what's necessary
