# Data Flow Documentation

This document describes the flow of data through the system, focusing on how information moves between different components and modules.

## Overview

The writing tools system has several key data flows that are essential to understand:

1. **Content Creation Flow**: How content is created, validated, and stored
2. **Content Build Flow**: How content is processed for publishing
3. **Image Processing Flow**: How images are processed and optimized
4. **Configuration Flow**: How configuration is loaded and used throughout the system
5. **Plugin Data Flow**: How plugins interact with the core system

## Content Creation Flow

```
User Command → CLI Parser → Content Creation Service → Template System → Validation → Storage
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **User Input**: The user executes a command (e.g., `write new article my-article "My Article"`)
2. **CLI Parser**: The command is parsed by the CLI handling system in `tools/write/src/cli.rs`
3. **Command Resolution**: The appropriate command handler is selected and executed
4. **Template Selection**: If applicable, a content template is selected and loaded
5. **Content Generation**: Initial content is generated using the template and user inputs
6. **Content Validation**: The generated content is validated using the validation rules
7. **Persistence**: The content is saved to the appropriate location in the content directory
8. **Post-Creation Actions**: Optional actions like opening an editor are performed

### Key Components

- **CLI Parser**: Handles user input and dispatches to the appropriate handlers
- **Content Service**: Manages the creation, validation, and storage of content
- **Template System**: Provides templates for new content
- **Validation System**: Ensures content meets the required standards
- **Storage System**: Manages the physical storage of content files

## Content Build Flow

```
Trigger → Content Indexer → Content Processor → Renderer → Output Generator
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Build Trigger**: A build is initiated (manual command or automated)
2. **Content Indexing**: All content items are discovered and indexed
3. **Incremental Determination**: If incremental building is enabled, changed files are identified
4. **Content Processing**: Content is processed (frontmatter extraction, markdown parsing)
5. **Rendering**: Content is rendered into the target format
6. **Output Generation**: Final outputs are written to the output directory
7. **Auxiliary Output**: Additional files like sitemaps, RSS feeds, and LLMs-friendly formats are generated

### Key Components

- **Content Indexer**: Finds and catalogs all content
- **Change Detector**: Identifies changes since the last build
- **Content Processor**: Processes raw content into structured data
- **Renderer**: Transforms structured data into output formats
- **Output Generator**: Writes final output files

## Image Processing Flow

```
Image Source → Image Loader → Processor Chain → Format Conversion → Output
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Image Discovery**: Source images are discovered or specified
2. **Image Loading**: Images are loaded into memory
3. **Image Analysis**: Image properties are analyzed
4. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - Resizing to target dimensions
   - Optimization based on image content
   - Quality adjustments
5. **Format Conversion**: Images are converted to target formats (WebP, AVIF, etc.)
6. **Output**: Processed images are saved to the output location

### Key Components

- **Image Loader**: Handles loading images from disk
- **Image Processor**: Applies transformations to images
- **Format Converter**: Converts images between formats
- **Image Optimizer**: Optimizes images for web delivery

## Configuration Flow

```
Config Sources → Config Loader → Config Cache → Consumers
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Config Location**: Configuration sources are identified
2. **Config Loading**: Configuration files are loaded and parsed
3. **Validation**: Configuration values are validated
4. **Normalization**: Configuration values are normalized
5. **Caching**: Configuration is cached for performance
6. **Distribution**: Configuration is made available to components

### Key Components

- **Config Loader**: Loads and parses configuration files
- **Config Validator**: Ensures configuration is valid
- **Config Cache**: Caches configuration for performance
- **Config Provider**: Makes configuration available to components

## Plugin Data Flow

```
Plugin Registration → Plugin Loading → Hook Registration → Hook Invocation → Data Exchange
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Plugin Discovery**: Available plugins are discovered
2. **Plugin Loading**: Plugins are loaded into the system
3. **Capability Registration**: Plugin capabilities and hooks are registered
4. **Hook Invocation**: Hooks are invoked at appropriate points
5. **Data Exchange**: Data is passed between core system and plugins
6. **Result Integration**: Plugin results are integrated into the core flow

### Key Components

- **Plugin Loader**: Discovers and loads plugins
- **Plugin Registry**: Maintains information about available plugins
- **Hook System**: Manages hook registration and invocation
- **Data Exchange**: Handles data passing between core and plugins

## Cross-Component Data Flow

### Content and Configuration Interaction

Configuration values influence how content is processed:

```
Configuration → Content Processor → Processed Content
```

### Content and Image Interaction

Images referenced in content are processed during build:

```
Content with Image References → Image Reference Extractor → Image Processor → Processed Images → Content with Optimized Images
```

### Plugin and Content Interaction

Plugins can modify content during processing:

```
Content → Plugin Hook → Modified Content
```

## Error Flow

```
Error Source → Error Context Addition → Error Categorization → Error Reporting
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Error Origin**: An error occurs in a component
2. **Context Addition**: Context is added to the error
3. **Error Wrapping**: The error is wrapped with additional information
4. **Error Categorization**: The error is categorized
5. **Error Reporting**: The error is reported to the user

### Key Components

- **Error Context**: Adds context to errors
- **Error Categories**: Categorizes errors for better handling
- **Error Reporter**: Reports errors to the user

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

Data flow is optimized through strategic caching:

- Configuration caching
- Template caching
- Processed content caching
- Rendered output caching

### Parallel Processing

Certain data flows support parallel processing:

- Image processing
- Content rendering
- Independent content item processing

## Conclusion

Understanding these data flows is essential for working with the system effectively. Each flow represents a core aspect of the system's functionality, and changes to these flows should be approached with careful consideration of their impact on the overall system.
