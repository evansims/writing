# Data Flow Documentation

This document describes the flow of data through the system.

## Key Data Flows

1. **Content Creation Flow**: Content creation, validation, and storage
2. **Content Build Flow**: Content processing for publishing
3. **Image Processing Flow**: Image processing and optimization
4. **Configuration Flow**: Configuration loading and usage
5. **Plugin Data Flow**: Plugin interaction with core system

## Processing Steps

### Content Creation

- User Input → CLI Parsing → Content Creation → Template Application → Validation → Storage

### Content Building

- Build Trigger → Content Indexing → Content Processing → Rendering → Output Generation

### Image Processing

- Image Selection → Format Conversion → Resizing → Optimization → Storage

### Configuration

- Config Loading → Validation → Distribution to Components

### Plugin System

- Plugin Registration → Hook Attachment → Event Triggering → Plugin Execution

## Cross-Component Data Flow

### Content and Configuration Interaction

Configuration values influence how content is processed:

```
Configuration → Content Processor → Processed Content
```

### Content and Image Interaction

Images referenced in content are processed during build:

```
Content with Image References → Image Reference Extractor → Image Processor → Processed Images → Content with Optimized Images
```

### Plugin and Content Interaction

Plugins can modify content during processing:

```
Content → Plugin Hook → Modified Content
```

## Error Flow

```
Error Source → Error Context Addition → Error Categorization → Error Reporting
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Error Origin**: An error occurs in a component
2. **Context Addition**: Context is added to the error
3. **Error Wrapping**: The error is wrapped with additional information
4. **Error Categorization**: The error is categorized
5. **Error Reporting**: The error is reported to the user

### Key Components

- **Error Context**: Adds context to errors
- **Error Categories**: Categorizes errors for better handling
- **Error Reporter**: Reports errors to the user

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

Data flow is optimized through strategic caching:

- Configuration caching
- Template caching
- Processed content caching
- Rendered output caching

### Parallel Processing

Certain data flows support parallel processing:

- Image processing
- Content rendering
- Independent content item processing

## Conclusion

Understanding these data flows is essential for working with the system effectively. Each flow represents a core aspect of the system's functionality, and changes to these flows should be approached with careful consideration of their impact on the overall system.
