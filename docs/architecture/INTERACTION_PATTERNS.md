# Interaction Patterns

This document describes the key interaction patterns used throughout the system.

## Key Patterns

1. **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates requests as objects
2. **Factory Pattern**: Creates objects without specifying concrete classes
3. **Observer Pattern**: Provides notifications and event handling
4. **Strategy Pattern**: Enables swappable algorithms
5. **Dependency Injection**: Provides dependencies to components
6. **Trait-based Polymorphism**: Defines abstractions and behaviors

## Implementation

Each pattern is implemented consistently across the codebase to maintain cohesion and reduce cognitive overhead.

### Command-Based Architecture

The CLI uses commands to represent user actions, with each command implementing the Command trait.

### Dependency Injection

Components receive dependencies through constructors or builders rather than creating them internally.

### Trait-Based Abstractions

Core functionality is defined through traits that enable different implementations and facilitate testing.
