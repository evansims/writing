- [ ] Integration test suite: < 60s execution time
- [ ] Full test suite with coverage: < 2m execution time

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Tool Isolation Principles

- Each tool should be testable independently
- Tools should have clear interfaces for mocking
- Avoid direct dependencies between tools
- Use common libraries for shared functionality
- Never test multiple tools together except in integration tests

### TDD Implementation

1. For new features:

   - Write test specifications first
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Refactor for maintainability
   - Verify coverage meets targets

2. For existing code:
   - Add test coverage for critical paths
   - Refactor for testability where needed
   - Use mock interfaces to isolate components
   - Add property-based tests for complex algorithms

### Dependency Injection

- Prefer trait-based interfaces for all components
- Use constructor injection for dependencies
- Create test-specific implementations of interfaces
- Use Mockall for generating mock implementations

### Test Data Management

- Use factories and builders for test data
- Implement property-based test generators
- Isolate test environments with fixtures
- Clean up all test resources after use

## EXAMPLES

### Unit Test Example (to standardize on)

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use common_test_utils::TestFixture;
    use common_test_utils::mocks::MockDependencyTool;

    #[test]
    fn test_function_with_valid_input() {
        // Arrange
        let fixture = TestFixture::new().unwrap();
        let input = fixture.create_valid_input();
        let mock_dependency = MockDependencyTool::new();
        mock_dependency.expect_some_method().returning(|_| Ok(()));

        // Create SUT with mocked dependency
        let system_under_test = SystemUnderTest::new(mock_dependency);

        // Act
        let result = system_under_test.function_under_test(input);

        // Assert
        assert!(result.is_ok());
        assert_eq!(result.unwrap(), expected_output);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_function_with_invalid_input() {
        // Arrange
        let fixture = TestFixture::new().unwrap();
        let input = fixture.create_invalid_input();
        let mock_dependency = MockDependencyTool::new();

        // Create SUT with mocked dependency
        let system_under_test = SystemUnderTest::new(mock_dependency);

        // Act
        let result = system_under_test.function_under_test(input);

        // Assert
        assert!(result.is_err());
        assert_eq!(result.unwrap_err().to_string(), expected_error);
    }
}
```

### Property-Based Test Example (to standardize on)

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod prop_tests {
    use super::*;
    use common_test_utils::proptest::*;
    use proptest::prelude::*;

    proptest! {
        #[test]
        fn test_function_properties(input in valid_input_strategy()) {
            // Setup mocked dependencies
            let mock_dependency = MockDependencyTool::new();
            mock_dependency.expect_some_method().returning(|_| Ok(()));

            // Create SUT with mocked dependency
            let system_under_test = SystemUnderTest::new(mock_dependency);

            // Property: function should not panic with valid input
            let result = system_under_test.function_under_test(input.clone());

            // Property: function should return result with same properties as input
            prop_assert!(result.property == input.expected_property);
        }
    }
}
```

### Integration Test Example (for Write/CLI tool)

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod integration_tests {
    use common_test_utils::integration::TestCommand;

    #[test]
    fn test_write_cli_workflow_success() {
        // Arrange - use the actual Write CLI tool, not mocks
        let command = TestCommand::new("write").unwrap();
        let test_input = "test input";

        // Act & Assert - test entire workflow across multiple tools
        let setup_output = command.assert_success(&["content", "new", "--title", "Test Article", "--topic", "blog"]);
        let main_output = command.assert_success(&["content", "edit", "--slug", "test-article"]);
        let result_output = command.assert_output_contains(&["content", "validate", "--slug", "test-article"], "Validation passed");

        // Final validation
        assert!(result_output.status.success());
    }
}
```
