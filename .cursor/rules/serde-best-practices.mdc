- Use `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` for easy serialization/deserialization
- Implement custom serialization/deserialization with `#[serde(...)]` attributes
- Use `serde_json` for JSON serialization/deserialization
- Implement `serde::Serializer` and `serde::Deserializer` for custom formats
- Use `#[serde(flatten)]` to merge nested structures during serialization
