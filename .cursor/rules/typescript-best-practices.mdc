- Use interfaces for object shapes and type aliases for union types or function types
- Implement type guards for runtime type checking
- Use readonly arrays and tuples where appropriate to ensure immutability
- Leverage utility types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, and `Pick` for type manipulation
- Use `as const` assertions to infer literal types automatically
