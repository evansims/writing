- Use connection pooling with `sqlx::Pool` for efficient database connections
- Implement prepared statements with `sqlx::query` for better performance and security
- Use `sqlx::query_as!` for direct mapping to Rust structs
- Implement transactions with `sqlx::Transaction` for data consistency
- Use `sqlx::migrate!` for database migrations
