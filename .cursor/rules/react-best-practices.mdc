- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement proper state management using `useState` or external libraries like Redux
- Utilize `useMemo` and `useCallback` for performance optimization
- Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors in components
- Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for code-splitting and lazy loading
